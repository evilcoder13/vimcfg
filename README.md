# vimcfg
My configuration for vim (suit my own taste) 

# Install:
Well, just install vim first if you haven't  
sudo apt install vim  
Then, put all these files under your home folder: 
cd ~  
git clone ...  
Install youcompleteme if you want:  
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/ 
python3 install.py -all  
All setup, just start using by call to:  
vim
